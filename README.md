# Quickstart Github!

Introduction to Github for researchers

This tutorial walks through an example workflow that uses Github, RStudio, and R to manage a project.

**Description:** Everyone who does research should be using Github. But, Github can be confusing to learn because it was developed for social coders (people writing open-source code that the entire community has an opportunity to edit).  Consequently, much of the functionality that is considered the “heart” of Github isn’t actually that useful to researchers who want to use Github.  

My goal is to provide a very basic introduction to Github that is focused on how scientists will use Github.
